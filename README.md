parity game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game

A parity game is an infinite game played between two players on a directed graph and is used to study problems in areas such as system validation and model checking.

The project implements a data structure for parity games and implements a solution to Zielonka's algorithm and an alternative solution based on the algorithm to optimize the computation time, with the optimized solution having a more pronounced advantage in solving large graphs.

Also this project includes the generation of different conditional directed graphs in order to validate the performance of the algorithm.
